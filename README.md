## Concurrent Hull
Finds the convex hull of a set of cartesian points with integer coordinates using a concurrent divide and conquer sterategy. 
Sychonronization done manually, implemented with a modified version of Baker's algorithm. The concurrent hull is found using a
concurrent version of Chan's algorithm which is asymptotically optimal.

## Motivation
Given as an assignment in CPSC 222 at UNBC, this project outlines serveral stages of learning within concurrent programming.

## Code style
Code formatting is done with respect to the Google Java style guidelines.
